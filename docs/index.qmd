## Background

[This repository](https://github.com/yevgenryeznik/restricted-two-arm) collects a set of `Julia` functions to simulate several _restricted randomization_ procedures, targeting _equal_ $1{:}1$ allocation in _two-arm_ clinical trials.

There are case studies included in the repository. 

## Restricted randomization

Let us assume that there are two treatment arms considered in a clinical trial: 

- _Experimental_ ($E$);
- _Control_ ($C$).

_Sample sizes_ on treatments are $n_E$ and $n_c$ respectively, and $n = n_E + n_C$ is a _total sample size_.

A restricted randomization procedure is defined as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi_1 &= \text{Pr}(\delta_1 = 1) = 0.5 \\
\phi_j &= \text{Pr}(\delta_j = 1|\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_{j-1}), \: j = 2, \ldots, n,
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-RR}

where $j$ is a number of a subject currently randomized in a trial (or an _allocation step_), and $\phi_j$is a _probability of tretament assignment_ for the $j^\text{th}$ subject, $j = 1, \ldots, n$.

$$
\delta_j = \left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
    1, \text{ if tretament }E \\
    0, \text{ if tretament }C
\end{array}
\right.    
$${#eq-trt-assignment}

There are several restricted randomziation procedures implemented in the current repository.

### Completely Randomized Design (CRD)

$$
\phi_j = 0.5, \: j = 1, \ldots, n.
$${#eq-crd}

### Truncated Binomial Design (TBD)

Treatment assignments are made with probability 0.5 until one of the treatments receives its quota of $\frac{n}{2}$ subjects; thereafter all remaining assignments are made deterministically to the opposite treatment.

For the current allocation step $j$, let $N_1$ and $N_2$ be the numbers of subjects allocated to treatments s.t. $N_1 + N_2 = j-1$. Then,   
$$
\phi_j = \left\{
    \begin{array}{rl}
    0.5, & \max(N_1, N_2) < \frac{n}{2} \\
    1, & N_1 < N_2 \\
    0, & N_1 > N_2
    \end{array}
\right.    
$${#eq-tbd}

### Permuted Block Design (PBD)

Treatment assignments are made in blocks of size $b$, where $b$ is an _even_ number. The probabilities of treatment assignments within each block are changed according the current imbalance in a block. 

At the $j^\text{th}$ allocation step, let $k$ be a number of the $j^\text{th}$ subject in a current block and $n_1$ be a number os subjects in a block allocated to treatment 1 ($E$). Then, 

$$
\phi_j = \frac{0.5*b-n_1}{b-k+1}.
$${#eq-pbd}
