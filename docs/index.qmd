## Background

[This repository](https://github.com/yevgenryeznik/restricted-two-arm) collects a set of `Julia` functions to simulate several _restricted randomization_ procedures, targeting _equal_ $1{:}1$ allocation in _two-arm_ clinical trials.

There are case studies included in the repository. 

## Restricted Randomization

Let us assume that there are two treatment arms considered in a clinical trial: 

- _Experimental_ ($E$);
- _Control_ ($C$).

_Sample sizes_ on treatments are $N_1$ ($n_E$) and $N_2$ ($n_c$) respectively, and $n = n_E + n_C$ is a _total sample size_.

A restricted randomization procedure is defined as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi_1 &= \text{Pr}(\delta_1 = 1) = 0.5 \\
\phi_j &= \text{Pr}(\delta_j = 1|\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_{j-1}), \: j = 2, \ldots, n,
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-RR}

where $j$ is a number of a subject currently randomized in a trial (or an _allocation step_), and $\phi_j$is a _probability of tretament assignment_ for the $j^\text{th}$ subject, $j = 1, \ldots, n$.

$$
\delta_j = \left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
    1, \text{ if tretament }E \\
    0, \text{ if tretament }C
\end{array}
\right.    
$${#eq-trt-assignment}

There are several restricted randomziation procedures implemented in the current repository.

### Completely Randomized Design, $\text{CRD}$

$$
\phi_j = 0.5, \: j = 1, \ldots, n.
$${#eq-crd}

### Truncated Binomial Design, $\text{TBD}$

Treatment assignments are made with probability 0.5 until one of the treatments receives its quota of $\frac{n}{2}$ subjects; thereafter all remaining assignments are made deterministically to the opposite treatment.

For the current allocation step $j$, let $N_1$ and $N_2$ be the numbers of subjects allocated to treatments s.t. $N_1 + N_2 = j-1$. Then,   
$$
\phi_j = \left\{
    \begin{array}{rl}
    0.5, & \max(N_1, N_2) < \frac{n}{2} \\
    1, & N_1 < N_2 \\
    0, & N_1 > N_2
    \end{array}
\right.,\: j = 1, \ldots, n.    
$${#eq-tbd}

### Permuted Block Design, $\text{PBD}(b)$

Treatment assignments are made in blocks of size $b$, where $b$ is an _even_ number. The probabilities of treatment assignments within each block are changed according the current imbalance in a block. 

At the $j^\text{th}$ allocation step, let $k$ be a number of the $j^\text{th}$ subject in a current block and $n_1$ be a number of subjects in a block allocated to treatment 1 ($E$). Then, 

$$
\phi_j = \frac{0.5b-n_1}{b-k+1}, \: j = 1, \ldots, n.
$${#eq-pbd}

### Random Allocation Rule, $\text{Rand}$ 

A version of PBD, when the block size $b$ equals to the total sample size $n$. At the $j^\text{th}$ allocation step,

$$
\phi_j = \frac{0.5n-N_1}{n-j+1}, \: j = 1, \ldots, n,
$${#eq-rand}

and $N_1$ is a number of subject already allocated to the treatment 1 ($E$). 

### Efron's Biased Coin Design, $\text{BCD}(p)$

At any allocation step, if treatment numbers $N_1$ and $N_2$ are balanced, the next assignment is made with probability 0.5; otherwise, the underrepresented treatment is assigned with probability $p$, where $0.5 < p \leq 1$ is a fixed and pre-specified parameter that determines the tradeoff between balance and randomness.

$$
\phi_j = \left\{
    \begin{array}{rl}
    0.5, & N_1 = N_2 \\
    p, & N_1 < N_2 \\
    1-p, & N_1 > N_2
    \end{array}
\right.,\: j = 1, \ldots, n.    
$${#eq-ebcd}

Note that $p=1$ corresponds to PBD with block size $b=2$.

### Adjustable Biased Coin Design, $\text{ABCD}(a)$

An extension of Efron's BCD. At the $j^\text{th}$  allocation step, given tretament numbers $N_1$ and $N_2$, $N_1 + N_2$, s.t. $N_1 + N_2 = j-1$, and imbalance $d = N_1-N_2$,

$$
\phi_j = \left\{
    \begin{array}{rl}
    0.5, & |d| \leq 1 \\
    \frac{|x|^a}{|x|^a + 1}, & d < -1 \\
    \frac{1}{|x|^a + 1}, & d > 1
    \end{array}
\right.,\: j = 1, \ldots, n,    
$${#eq-abcd}

where $a>0$ is a parameter of the randomization procedure.


### Generalized Biased Coin Design, $\text{GBCD}(\gamma)$

A generalization of Efron's BCD. At the $j^\text{th}$  allocation step, given tretament numbers $N_1$ and $N_2$, $N_1 + N_2$, s.t. $N_1 + N_2 = j-1$, 

$$
\phi_j = \left\{
    \begin{array}{rl}
    0.5, & j = 1 \\
    \frac{N_2^\gamma}{N_1^\gamma + N_2^\gamma}, & j = 2, \ldots, n,
    \end{array}
\right.    
$${#eq-gbcd}

where $\gamma > 0$ is a parameter of the randomization procedure.

### Big Stick Design, $\text{BSD}(mti)$

An example of _maximum tolerated imbalance_ (MTI) procedures. It makes prediction of the future treatment allocations more difficult (even knowing the current sizes of the treatment groups) and controls treatment imbalance at a predefined threshold throughout the experiment. A general MTI procedure specifies a certain boundary for treatment imbalance, say $mti > 0$, that cannot be exceeded. 

At the $j^\text{th}$  allocation step, given tretament numbers $N_1$ and $N_2$, $N_1 + N_2$, s.t. $N_1 + N_2 = j-1$, and imbalance $d = N_1-N_2$,

$$
\phi_j = \left\{
    \begin{array}{rl}
    0.5, & |d| < mti \\
    0, & d = mti \\
    1, & d = -mti
    \end{array}
\right.,\: j = 1, \ldots, n.    
$${#eq-bsd}

### Biased Coin Design With Imbalance Tolerance, $\text{BCDWIT}(p, mti)$

A combination of Efron's BCD and BSD. At the $j^\text{th}$  allocation step, given tretament numbers $N_1$ and $N_2$, $N_1 + N_2$, s.t. $N_1 + N_2 = j-1$, and imbalance $d = N_1-N_2$,

$$
\phi_j = \left\{
    \begin{array}{rl}
    0.5, & |d| < mti~\&~d = 0\\
    p, & |d| < mti~\&~d < 0 \\
    1-p, & |d| < mti~\&~d > 0 \\
    0, & d = mti \\
    1, & d = -mti
    \end{array}
\right.,\: j = 1, \ldots, n.    
$${#eq-bcdwit}

## Operational Characteristics

Two important characteristics of a randomization procedure are _imbalance_ and _randomness_.

### Imbalance

After the $j^\text{th}$ allocations ($1 \leq j \leq b$), 
$$
D(j) = N_1 - N_2
$${#eq-imb}

is a _tretament imbalance_, where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the numbers of treatment assigments to treatment 1 ($E$) and 2 ($C$) respectively.

For any $j \geq 1$, $D(j)$ is a _random variable_ with a probability distribution determined by the chosen randomization procedure.

Several measures of imbalance can be considered, for example, the _absolute value of imbalance_, 

$$
|D(j)|, \: j = 1, \ldots, n. 
$${#eq-abs-imb}

$|D(i)| = 0$ indicates that the trial is perfectly balanced.

One can also consider $\Pr(|D(j)| = 0)$, the probability of achieving exact balance after $j$ allocation steps. In particular, $\Pr(|D(n)| = 0)$ is the probability that the final treatment numbers are balanced. 

Two other useful summary measures are the _expected imbalance at the_ $j^\text{th}$ _step_, $E|D(j)|$ and the _expected value of the maximum imbalance_ of the entire randomization sequence, $E\left(\max\limits_{1\leq j\leq n}|D(j)|\right)$.

## Randomness

Greater forcing of balance implies _lack of randomness_. A procedure that lacks randomness may be susceptible to _selection bias_.

A classic approach to quantify the degree of susceptibility of a procedure to selection bias is the _Blackwell-Hodges model_. 

Let $G_j = 1$ (or $0$), if at the $j^\text{th}$ allocation step an investigator makes a correct (or incorrect) guess on treatment assignment $\delta_j$, given past allocations $\boldsymbol{\delta}_{iâˆ’1}$.

Then. the _predictability of the design_ at the $j^\text{th}$ step is the expected value of $G_j$, i.e. $E(G_j) = \Pr(G_j = 1)$.

Blackwell and Hodges considered the _expected bias factor_, the difference between expected total number of correct guesses of a given sequence of random assignments and the similar quantity obtained from CRD for which treatment assignments are made independently with equal probability: 

$$
E(F) = E\left(\sum_{j=1}^nG_j\right) - \frac{n}{2}. 
$$

This quantity equal to zero for CRD, and it is positive for restricted randomization procedures (greater values indicate higher expected bias). 

One can also consider an _expected proportion of deterministic assignments_ in a sequence as another measure of lack of randomness.
