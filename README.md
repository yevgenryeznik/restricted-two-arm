# Restricted randomization for two-arm trials with equal $1{:}1$ allocation

A set of `Julia` functions to simulate _two-arm_ clinical trials targeting _equal 1:1 allocation_. 
So far, _eight different randomization procedures_ have been implemented.
There is a _simulation example_ comparing procedures in terms of _**Balance-Randomness trade-off**_.

More details about the implemented randomization procedure can be found [here](https://yevgenryeznik.github.io/restricted-two-arm/){:target="_blank"}.

There are simulation examples available:
  - Simulations from the publication [**A roadmap to using randomization in clinical trials**](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01303-z).
