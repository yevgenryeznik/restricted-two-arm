# Restricted randomization for two-arm trials with equal $1{:}1$ allocation

A set of `Julia` functions to simulate _two-arm_ clinical trials targeting _equal $1{:}1$ allocation_. 
So far, _eight different randomization procedures_ have been implemented.
There is a _simulation example_ comparing procedures in terms of _**Balance-Randomness trade-off**_.

More details about the implemented randomization procedure can be found [here](https://github.com/yevgenryeznik/restricted-multi-arm/wiki/Restricted-Randomization-for-Multi-arm-Trials-with-Unequal-Allocation).

There are simulation examples available:
