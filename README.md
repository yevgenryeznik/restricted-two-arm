# Restricted randomization for two-arm trials with equal $1{:}1$ allocation

A set of `Julia` functions to simulate _restricted randomization_ for _two-arm_ clinical trials with _equal 1:1 allocation_. 

More details about the implemented randomization procedure can be found [here](https://yevgenryeznik.github.io/restricted-two-arm).

There are simulation examples available:
