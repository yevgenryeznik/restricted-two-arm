# Here, we define a set of functions used to calculate probabilities of 
# treatment assignments, given restricted radomization procedure.
# Input parameters indicate:
#   - rnd -- a type of rundomization procedure used.
#   -  N1 -- a number of subjects allocated to treatment 1.
#   -  N2 -- a number of subjects allocated to treatment 2.
